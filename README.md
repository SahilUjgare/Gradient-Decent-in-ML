# Gradient Descent Example in Machine Learning

This project demonstrates a simple implementation of **Gradient Descent** for **Linear Regression** using Python and NumPy.

## 🚀 Features
- Implements gradient descent from scratch
- Visualizes data, regression line, and cost function
- Adjustable learning rate and iterations

## 📘 How Gradient Descent Works
Gradient Descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize a cost function by iteratively moving towards the minimum value based on the gradient (slope).
